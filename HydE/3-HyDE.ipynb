Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\\nJobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak\\'s Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. \\nJobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the largely unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 (for example, the Aldus Pagemaker) with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.\\nIn 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company\\'s board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he bought the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm, which was spun off independently as Pixar. Pixar produced the first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story (1995), and became a leading animation studio, producing dozens of commercially successful and critically acclaimed films.\\nIn 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company\\'s acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the \"Think different\" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad.

      "\n",
      "While Steve Jobs is widely celebrated as a visionary leader and the driving force behind Apple's success, his journey with the company wasn't a straight path to triumph.  In fact, Jobs experienced a dramatic downfall and was unceremoniously ousted from the very company he co-founded.  This pivotal moment in tech history occurred on **September 17, 1985**.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Seeds of Discontent:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Jobs' departure wasn't a sudden event. Several factors contributed to the escalating tension between him and Apple's board of directors:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Personality Clashes:** Jobs' abrasive management style and relentless drive often clashed with the more collaborative and diplomatic approach favored by other executives. \n",
      "* **The Macintosh's Struggles:**  While the Macintosh, a revolutionary personal computer launched in 1984, initially garnered critical acclaim, its sales lagged behind expectations. This commercial underperformance fueled concerns about Jobs' leadership and strategic decisions.\n",
      "* **Internal Power Struggles:**  Jobs' ambition and desire for control created friction within the company. He clashed with John Sculley, the CEO Jobs had personally recruited away from Pepsi, leading to a power struggle for control of Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Board's Decision:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Faced with declining sales and internal turmoil, Apple's board of directors, heavily influenced by Sculley, decided to remove Jobs from his position as head of Macintosh development. This decision resulted in Jobs' forced resignation from Apple.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Aftermath:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Jobs' departure sent shockwaves through the tech industry. He was viewed by many as the driving force behind Apple's innovation and success. The company struggled in the years following his exit, failing to maintain its momentum in the rapidly evolving personal computer market.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**A Comeback Story:**\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Jobs' story took an incredible turn. He went on to found NeXT, a computer company that, while not commercially successful, developed groundbreaking technologies that would later be incorporated into Apple products. In 1997, Apple acquired NeXT, bringing Jobs back to the company he had once been ousted from. \n",
      "\n",
      "This marked the beginning of Apple's resurgence under Jobs' leadership. He steered the company towards a new era of innovation, introducing iconic products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, transforming Apple into the tech giant it is today.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Steve Jobs' firing from Apple serves as a reminder that even the most visionary leaders can face setbacks and that success is rarely linear. It also highlights the importance of resilience, adaptability, and the power of second chances. \n",
